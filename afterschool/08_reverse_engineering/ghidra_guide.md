# Ghidra Guide for Beginners
## Windows (View Windows)
By default, the following windows are open in the Ghidra UI:
* Program Tree
  * parts of the binary separated by their Assembly code components, such as `bss`, `rodata`, etc..
* Symbol Tree
  * parts of the binary separated by their symbolic names, such as `functions`, `imports`, and `global variables`
* Data Type Manager
  * contains a list of all data types used by the binary, such as `strings`, `integers`, `floats`, etc
* Listing
  * the actual disassembly instructions mapped to memory addresses
* Decompile
  * attempts to interpret the current function's disassembly instructions into C-like code
* Console - Scripting
  * allows running of scripts and system commands
Should you ever close one of these by accident, you can do to the `Window` tab on the top of the UI and click on the one you want to restore
