# Concept
* the robots.txt file
# Method of solve
* this webpage references Google not being to find something
* it's similar to something we saw in a famous CTF web app hacking game, Natas from Overthewire
* so we can go directly to the `robots.txt` page here
* `https://ringzer0ctf.com/robots.txt`
* And from there, we see a directory that should not be indexed by the search engine robots
* the flag is in that directory
