# username / password
level08 / level08
# goal
* World readable files strike again. Check what that user was up to, and use it to log into flag08 account.
* To do this level, log in as the level08 account with the password level08. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag08.
# concept
* world readable files
* PCAP file reading
* interpretation of special characters
# method of solve
* copy the PCAP file located in the home directory
* look at the TCP conversation in Wireshark
* there's a line that looks like this
```
backdoor...00Rm8.ate
```
* this is the password, but for each of the `.` characters, it's actually a backspace, which deletes a character
* if we look at the conversation as a Hex dump, we see that each of the dots in the password is a `0x7a` character, which is the delete character
* the actual password after applying this rule is `backd00Rmate`
* this is the password for the flag08 user
