# username / password
level06 / level06
# goal
* The flag06 account credentials came from a legacy unix system.
* To do this level, log in as the level06 account with the password level06. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag06.
# concept
* legacy UNIX system password storage
* legacy UNIX systems stored user passwords directly in the `/etc/passwd` file
* the legacy UNIX systems used DES as its hashing method
# method of solve
* access the password hash in the `/etc/passwd` file
```
cat /etc/passwd | grep flag06
```
* copy the password hash to a file, `hash.txt`
* use John the Ripper to crack the hash
```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=descrypt hash.txt
```
* the password is `hello`
* use that password to login as the `flag06` user
