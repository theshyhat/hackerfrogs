# username / password
level00 / level00
# objective
*This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.
* Alternatively, look at the find man page.
* To access this level, log in as level00 with the password of level00.
# concept
* SUID binaries for privilege escalation
* SUID binaries run with the privileges of the file's owner, which can sometimes allow for shell access in the context of the file owner
# method of solve
* find a list of SUID binaries with the following command
```
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
* The binary we're looking for is at `/rofs/bin/.../flag00`
* simply running the binary gives us a shell in the context of the target user, `flag00`
```
/rofs/bin/.../flag00
getflag
```
