# Concept
* How to use error messages to construct a valid request.
* How HTTP methods are used by RESTful APIs.
* How changing the HTTP method can reveal additional functionality.
# Method of solve
* login to the application
* attempt to go through the process of buying the `Lightweight 1337 Leather Jacket`
* go to the Burp HTTP Proxy tab and observe that there is a request to the `/api/products/1/price` endpoint
* the response to this request is the price of the jacket
* we can attept to use different HTTP verbs to make requests to that endpoint
* the `PATCH` method returns an error, letting us that we need to send JSON data to complete the request successfully
* we need to send the following headers and JSON data to make the request:
```
Method must be changed to PATCH
Content-Type must be changed to application/json
Data must include this JSON string:
{"price":0,"message":"This discount was brought to you by HackerFrogs!"}
```
* send the request through and the price of the jacket becomes zero dollars
* buy the zero dollar jacket to complete the lab
