# Concept
* using different HTTP methods on a webpage
# Method of solve
* the landing page points us to a specific endpoint: `http://momo.hackmyvm.eu/ZiP004JfyGh/aaAxghuyrtlksd.php`
* if we go to this page, then it says it has the flag, but it doesn't reveal its contents
* to get the contents we need to send a POST request to the page. We can use this command with `curl`:
```
curl -X POST -v http://momo.hackmyvm.eu/ZiP004JfyGh/aaAxghuyrtlksd.php
```
