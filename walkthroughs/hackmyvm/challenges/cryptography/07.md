# Concept
* mirrored letters
* base64
# Method of solve
* the string looks like a mirrored version of a base64-encoded string
* when we reverse the string, it looks like this:
```
ƧƎƖWɘzЯςMWqOMƐʞ0dX0=
```
* we can try to map each of the mirrored letters to a regular ASCII character
```
echo -n SE1WezR2MWpOM3k0bX0= | base64 -d
```
