# Concept
* conversion of time zones
* local time vs UTC time
# Method of solve
* the challenge talks about time zones and UTC time. There are a set of coordinates included in the chall description
```
21°19'54.5"N 157°55'10.3"W
```
* if we lookup these coodinates, they are in Hawaii
* if we click on the `Check` button on the website, it tells us our time zone
* so we need to change our time zone to HST, the correct for Hawaii, in our system clock
* after that, click on the `Check` button and we're done
* the answer is `Datumsgrenze`
