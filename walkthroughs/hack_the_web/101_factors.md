# method of solve
* use an online resource to get the answer, because we are not good at math
* they're asking for the largest number that factors into this number:
```
86418641888888&
```
* we use the following website to get the answer:
`https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=prime+factorization+864186418888888888802470247`
* the answer is `1111111111111111111` <-- nineteen 1s
